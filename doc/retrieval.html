<h1> Retrieval benchmark </h1>

<p>
Retrieval benchmark tests feature detectors in a simple retrieval
system setting. Changing the detector and measuring the performance of
the system can comparatively asses feature detector
performance. Implemented retrieval system is based on [2] which uses
K-Nearest Neighbours in the whole descriptors database together with a
simple voting criterion.
</p>

<p>
Retrieval dataset contains set of images and a set of queries,
i.e. images which we want to look for in the database. Based on the
query ground truth data the Average Precision (area under the
precision-recall curve) is calculated and averaged over all queries to
get the Mean Average Precision of the detector.
</p>

<p>
The interface to the retrieval benchmark is similar to the
repeatability benchmark as can be seen from the example which
calculates the Mean Average Precision of the retrieval system for the
SIFT detector and descriptor.
</p>

<precode type="matlab">
detector = localFeatures.VlFeatSift();
dataset = dataset.VggRetrievalDataset('Category','oxbuild','Lite',true);
retBenchmark = benchmarks.RetrievalBenchmark();
[mAP queriesAP] = retBenchmark.testFeatureExtractor(detector, dataset);
</precode>

<p>
This benchmark uses parfor loop for both computing the features from
the dataset images and for evaluating the queries. As the lite version
of the oxbuild dataset contains 660 images it can improve the
evaluation time significantly.
