This package implements detector benchmarks for various publically available
interest point detectors.

------- First time installation instructions -----------
Run the following commands from the matlab prompt. Make sure your working
directory is at the root (i.e. it looks like .../vlfeat_benchmarks/)

compile_mex(); % To compile the mex files
install();     % To install all third party dependencies

------- Running the benchmark --------------------------
setup();                         % Setups the paths properly
affineDetectors.benchmarkDemo(); % Runs a demonstration of the benchmark


------ Cleaning up installation -----------------------
In case the install() command above is interrupted, or doesn't complete for some
reason, you can clear up all the downloaded third party software and re-install
from scratch by running the following:

clean();         % Will delete all the third party directories
install();       % To install all third party dependencies
